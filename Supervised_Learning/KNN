# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a versatile supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Its operation is grounded in a simple yet effective principle.

## How It Works
- **Distance Calculation**: For a given unlabeled data point, KNN computes the Euclidean distance to other points in the dataset.
- **Sorting and Selecting Neighbors**: These distances are sorted, and the 'k' nearest points are selected, where 'k' is a predefined constant.
- **Classification or Regression**: The unlabeled point is then classified based on the majority label or average outcome of these 'k' points.

## Key Features
- **Intuitive**: Classifies or predicts based on the proximity to known data.
- **User-defined 'k'**: Flexibility in choosing the number of neighbors considered.

This simplicity and direct approach make KNN an intuitive and straightforward choice for many real-world scenarios.
